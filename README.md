# Silence Enter The Forest

Silence is a game I had to make in the third year of university. It was written from scratch in C++ with various libraries such as OpenGL and SDL.

## Overview

So Silence is just a simple horror game. You start in a building where you have to find a key to escape, you can also find tools to help you. Once you have exited the building you then have to survive a horror monster by finding another key in a forest to unlock the gate and get out of the level.

### Technical Achievments
* Custom hardware accelerated 3D renderer for the game
* 3D audio.
* A* pathfinding
* 3D Heightmap generation
* Video playback
* Gamepad support
* Proper window settings support.
* and much more

## Installation

If you would like to run the application locally for your own testing and overview clone the repo like so.

```git clone https://github.com/william-taylor/silence-enter-the-forest```

You should be able to run this easily but just building and running the Visual Studio Solution.

## Future Features

* Graphics settings
* Additional levels
* Revamped models
